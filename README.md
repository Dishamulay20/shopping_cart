<h1>About</h1>

In this project, users can visit the website as both customers and sellers, and then register and log in. When a user logs in as a customer, they can view all of the products available for purchase, filter and search for items based on various categories, and add to cart. They can add multiple items to the cart and increase or decrease the quantity in the cart. Once the cart has been updated, the user can proceed to checkout, where all the shopping details, including the delivery address, are provided.
